A central access point for verified disaster data, tools, and platforms related to the recent floods, landslides, and cyclone Ditwah impact in Sri Lanka.

This hub collects official datasets, real-time dashboards, satellite intelligence, and community-built tools into one place. So, anyone can understand what’s happening, how organizations are responding, and where to find help.
